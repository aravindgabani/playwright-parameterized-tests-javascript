# Playwright Parameterized Tests with JavaScript

This project demonstrates **Playwright data-driven testing** using **Excel as a test data source**.  
It follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern and shows how to **parameterize Playwright tests** dynamically.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Getting Started With Playwright Parameterized Tests

We are going to use:

- **Playwright with JavaScript** (test framework)
- **VS Code** (code editor)
- **POM** (separate file to store page locators)
- **ExcelJS** (`excelUtils.js` to read/write test data from Excel file)

## ðŸ“¥ Download Project Files

You can download individual project files here:

- [LoginPage.js](./pages/LoginPage.js)  
- [loginExcel.spec.js](./tests/loginExcel.spec.js)  
- [excelUtils.js](./utilities/excelUtils.js)  
- [testData.xlsx](./utilities/testData.xlsx)
